# ARTIFICIAL_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_RESEARCH

VisionQantech — Research repository for safe, reproducible work on advanced AI capabilities and alignment. This repository contains a scaffold to organize experiments, documentation, and safety practices.

Goals
- Provide a safety-first research scaffold for experiments in interpretability, scalable oversight, and robustness.
- Encourage reproducible small-scale experiments and careful safety reviews before any scaling.

Quick start
1. Clone: git clone https://github.com/VisionQantech/ARTIFICIAL_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_RESEARCH.git
2. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install deps: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run a toy experiment: python src/example_toy_transformer.py

Safety & sharing
- This repo emphasizes safety. Do not publish or scale experiments without an internal safety review. See SAFETY.md for the safety checklist.

Repository layout
- src/: reference code and small toy experiments
- experiments/: experiment configs and logs
- research/: notes and research plans
- docs/: design documents and evaluation suites
